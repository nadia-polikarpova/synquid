- Memoization
	- How to transform cached results when adding more assumptions? Having a weaker/stronger spec?
- Symmetry analysis: if a function result type is symmetric in values of arg, then we can cut the symmetry
- Match through CA

- Multisets and sequences
- Abstract refinements
- Infer cond qualifiers
- LFP solver for when CA is not required?
- Bring symbolic search back? (Just for scalars?)

- BUG: well-formedness constraints should be added in the environement where a type variable is created, rather when it gets unified, since the latter may have more variables after decomposing sybtyping over function types
- When a measure is not mentioned in the goal spec, remove it from the componenets?
- If we are looking for a datatype with a constraint on a measure that, for a certain constructor, only depends on some arguments, we can test that subtyping before finding all the other arguments
- When generating E-terms: if a type of a later term (argument, result) does not depend on the type, no need to reconsider it when the later terms fails

Front-end
	- Move tokens into a separate file and reuse in pretty pritner
	- Make resolver multi-pass so that order of declarations doesn't matter
	- Check if wf-metric is defined
	- Type synonym arguments
	- Attach positions to AST nodes?
