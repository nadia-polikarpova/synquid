- Symmetry analysis: if a function result type is symmetric in values of arg, then we can cut the symmetry
- When a measure is not mentioned in the goal spec, remove it from the componenets?
- If we are looking for a datatype with a constraint on a measure that, for a certain constructor, only depends on some arguments, we can test that subtyping before finding all the other arguments
- Memoization
	- How to transform cached results when adding more assumptions? Having a weaker/stronger spec?
- When generating E-terms: if a type of a later term (argument, result) does not depend on the type, no need to reconsider it when the later terms fails	

- Abstract refinements
