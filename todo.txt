- Memoization
	- How to transform cached results when adding more assumptions? Having a weaker/stronger spec?
- Recast measures are decomposing to arguments?
- When generating E-terms: if a type of a later term (argument, result) does not depend on the type, no need to reconsider it when the later terms fails	
- Pass the spec down to eGen, when generating app, check if fun ==> !spec, in that case no argument exists
