- Check for false LHS when validating constraints?
- New benchmark: inc list merge that does not use insert (needs more complex termination criterion + pruning dead branches because of nested matches)
- Incremental unification like in the paper
- Fix symbol instantiations (in abstract symbols, should be one per leaf constraint)
- E-guess caching
- Abstract refinements
