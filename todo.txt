- Type classes (to help instantiate qualifiers)	

- Do something with datatype equality: does it make everything slower? Eq?

- Forget unknowns between branches
- Try to reduce the size of environment embedding? 
- Memoization: remove subsumed components?
- Prove measure postconditions
- BUG: polymorphic qualifier extraction
- Check that the first constructor is the base case
- When a measure is not mentioned in the goal spec, remove it from the componenets?
- If we are looking for a datatype with a constraint on a measure that, for a certain constructor, only depends on some arguments, we can test that subtyping before finding all the other arguments

Front-end
	- Make resolver multi-pass so that order of declarations doesn't matter
	- Check if wf-metric is defined
	- Attach positions to AST nodes?
