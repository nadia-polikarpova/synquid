- Incremental unification like in the paper
- E-guess caching; even more general: anything with the same or weaker type we don't need
- Pass the spec down to eGen, when generating app, check if fun ==> !spec, in that case no argument exists
- Check for false LHS when validating constraints?
- New benchmark: inc list merge that does not use insert (needs more complex termination criterion + pruning dead branches because of nested matches)

- Fix symbol instantiations (in abstract symbols, should be one per leaf constraint)
- Abstract refinements
