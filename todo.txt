- Pruning dead branches in nested matches (Check for false LHS when validating constraints?)
- Infer conditional qualifiers from types
- E-guess caching; even more general: anything with the same or weaker type we don't need
- Pass the spec down to eGen, when generating app, check if fun ==> !spec, in that case no argument exists

- Abstract refinements
